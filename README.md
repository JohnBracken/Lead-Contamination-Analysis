The following code performs an analysis using SAS
about lead contamination in New York State school districts.
The district with the most incidents of high lead levels
was determined, and news articles confirmed lead issues
in that district at the time the data was taken.  The latitude
and longitude of each district was available, and the mean
location was determined to be White Lake, NY.  Finally,
only data for the Buffalo school districts was isolated and
exported to a csv file.
